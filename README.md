# php-backend

Alternative (legacy) backend for [lex-js](https://github.com/lex-js/lex-js/) written in PHP.

Still can be used, since it remains compatible with the main implementation written in NodeJS.

## Using

Copy contents of both this repo and [lex-js](https://github.com/lex-js/lex-js/) to your webroot. You need Apache HTTP Server with `mod_rewrite` enabled (though it's easy to configure URL rewriting manually for any other server software - see `.htaccess` file).
